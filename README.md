# Android_ArmadilLogin
ArmadilLogin is intended to demonstrate how a simple, convenient, and secure login variant could look that is suitable for the broadest possible user base. The FIDO2 standard is implemented, which allows passwordless authentication. The public key authentication method used instead increases security and protection against various attacks such as phishing compared to conventional password authentication. In addition, this project will investigate how well technically inexperienced or mentally or physically impaired people can handle this type of login.
